# MINI-FLIX

Stand alone distributed streaming service with integrated HTML5 Video players and basic Javascript logique and CSS effects.

It is a free project to show off HTML, Javascript and CSS skills and streaming knowledge.

I have a website where MINI-FLIX is installed
https://free-iptv-quebec.weebly.com/

It is just a learning project and it is free to use.

Next step is X-FLIX a more serious and developped a distributed web based streaming service.
